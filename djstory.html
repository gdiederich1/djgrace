    <div id="bloackb" class="block">
      <p>I grew up in a very musical family. My father played the saxophone with a  "band of buddies" from his college days, and he is now the local high school band teacher. My mother is the singer in the family, and she is a regular lead performer in musicals with our community theater. Needless to say, my three siblings and I all took music lessions. But even though I was the one who never could settle on a favorite instrument, I'm the only one who went into the music business! Early on, music became my thing. I could name any song on the radio and tell you not only who was singing it, but who wrote it and when. At my senior prom, I was at the turntable more than I was on the dance floor. During college, I supplemented my income by Dj-ing fraternity-and-soroity-sponsored parties and other campus events. Eventually, I landed a job with a radio station. That was cool, but I missed being part of all the action and fun that people were having at a partying with music. let's face it, being a Dj is the closest thing to being a rock star without having to play an instrument! So, I started DJ Turntable, and I haven't stopped spinning since. I loe what I do and so will you. - Dylan Jackson</p>
